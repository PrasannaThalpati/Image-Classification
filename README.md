# Image Classification

Here I have created a model using deep learning which classifies the image of the cat or dog. The main goal of this model is to develop a system that can identify images of cats and dogs. The input image will be analyzed and then the output is predicted. The model that is implemented can be extended to a website or any mobile device as per the need.
